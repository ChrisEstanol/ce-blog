    <p>I am a Ruby on Rails developper, french native based in Cali Colombia. After more than 10 years working as a sales and marketing exec for tech companies I challenged myself to start over and become a Developer. I started learning development online through websites like Codeacademy and Codeschool and graduated from the first coding bootcamp in Colombia <a href="http://makeitreal.camp">Makeitreal.camp</a>. I also completed a 3 month workshop <a href="http://apps.co">apps.co</a> to design and launch a startup based on the lean methodolgy, so I am pretty familiar with validating and prototyping business idea into a functional product.</p>

    <p>The technologies I am found of include: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Git, Heroku, Redis, Jekyll.</p>
