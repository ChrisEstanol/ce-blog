Let's get started this blogging thing with a bit of inside on how to get started with Jekyll and host it for free with github pages.
It took me a while to figure out the whole process and I actually had to use [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) to get over a 302 error.

## Jekyll

[Jekyll](http://Jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator widely used amongst developer, designer or anybody just wiling to write from a simple editor like Sublime or Atom. Jekyll uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax to format the post into HTML. It is pretty lightweight, easy to use but the best thing about Jekyll is that it can be hosted on [Github](http://github.com) for free.
Jekyll has a very comprehensive documentation to get you started in no time. To start exploring how Jekyll works
just run the following [commands](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).
The easiest way to get you started is to fork an existing repo.

### Here are my top 10 jekyll themes/repos:

* [Jekyll incorporated](http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/)
* [Hyde](http://andhyde.com/)
* [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com/)
* [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/)
* [Clean Blog](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/)
* [Shiori](http://ellekasai.github.io/shiori/)
